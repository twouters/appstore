REST API
========

A REST API for publishing and deleting app releases has been built into the store from day one to help release automation.

TODO: talk about rest usage workflow


Specification
-------------

The following API routes are present:

* :ref:`api-all-releases`

* :ref:`api-delete-app`

* :ref:`api-delete-release`

* :ref:`api-create-release`

.. _api-all-releases:

Get All Apps and Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This route will return all releases to display inside Nextcloud's apps admin area.

* **Url**: GET /api/v1/platform/{**platform-version**}/apps.json
* **Url parameters**:

  * **platform-version**: semantic version, digits only: Returns all the apps and their releases that work on this version. If an app has no working releases, the app will be excluded

* **Authentication**: None

* **Caching**: `ETag <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag>`_

* **Example CURL request**::

    curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/platform/9.0.0/apps.json -H 'If-None-Match: "1-1-2016-06-17 23:08:58.042321+00:00"'

* **Returns**: application/json

    ]

translations
    Translated fields are stored inside a translations object. They can have any size, depending on if there is a translation. If a required language is not found, you should fall back to English.

min-version, max-version
    Required versions (minimum and maximum versions) are stored in String fields. If a field is empty, this means that there is no version requirement. Minimum and maximum versions are inclusive, e.g. if your app works only on PHP 5.5 and 5.6, the minimum version will be 5.5.0 while the maximum version will be 5.6.*

checksum
    The checksum is generated by running sha256sum over the downloaded archive.

.. _api-delete-app:

Delete an App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only app owners are allowed to delete an app. The owner is the user that pushes the first release of an app to the store.

Deleting an app will also delete all releases which are associated with it.

* **Url**: DELETE /api/v1/apps/{**app-id**}

* **Url parameters**:

 * **app-id**: app id, lower case ASCII characters and underscores are allowed

* **Authentication**: Basic

* **Example CURL request**::

    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/apps/news -u "user:password"


* **Returns**:

 * **HTTP 204**: If the app was deleted successfully
 * **HTTP 400**: If the app could not be found
 * **HTTP 401**: If the user is not authenticated
 * **HTTP 403**: If the user is not authorized to delete the app

.. _api-delete-release:

Delete an App Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Only app owners or co-maintainers are allowed to delete an app release. The owner is the user that pushes the first release of an app to the store.

* **Url**: DELETE /api/v1/apps/{**app-id**}/releases/{**app-version**}

* **Url parameters**:

 * **app-id**: app id, lower case ASCII characters and underscores are allowed
 * **app-version**: app version, semantic version, digits only

* **Authentication**: Basic

* **Example CURL request**::

    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/apps/news/releases/9.0.0 -u "user:password"


* **Returns**:

  * **HTTP 204**: If the app release was deleted successfully
  * **HTTP 400**: If the app release could not be found
  * **HTTP 401**: If the user is not authenticated
  * **HTTP 403**: If the user is not authorized to delete the app release


.. _api-create-release:

Release or Update a New App Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following request will create a new app release:

* **Url**: POST /api/v1/apps/releases

* **Authentication** Basic

* **Content-Type**: application/json

* **Request body**:

  * **download**: An Https (Http is not allowed!) link to the archive packaged (maximum size: 20 Megabytes) as tar.gz, info.xml must be smaller than 512Kb
  * **checksum (Optional)**: If not given we will calculate the sha256sum on the downloaded archive. If you are paranoid or host your packages on a host that you don't trust, you can supply your own sha256sum which can be generated by running::

      sha256sum release.tar.gz

  .. code-block:: json

      {
          "download": "https://example.com/release.tar.gz",
          "checksum": "65e613318107bceb131af5cf8b71e773b79e1a9476506f502c8e2017b52aba15"
      }


* **Example CURL request**::

        curl -X POST -u "user:password" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/apps/releases -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"download":"https://example.com/release.tar.gz"}'

* **Returns**:

  * **HTTP 200**: If the app release was update successfully
  * **HTTP 201**: If the app release was created successfully
  * **HTTP 400**: If the app contains invalid data, is too large or could not be downloaded
  * **HTTP 401**: If the user is not authenticated
  * **HTTP 403**: If the user is not authorized to delete the app release

If there is no app with the given app id yet, a new app is created and the owner is set in to the logged in user. Then the **info.xml** file which lies in the compressed archive's folder **app-id/appinfo/info.xml** is being parsed and validated. The validated result is then saved in the database. Both owners and co-maintainers are allowed to upload new releases.

A minimum valid **info.xml** would look like this:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <info>
        <id>news</id>
        <name>News</name>
        <description>An RSS/Atom feed reader</description>
        <author>Bernhard Posselt</author>
        <category>multimedia</category>
        <version>8.8.2</version>
        <licence>agpl</licence>
        <dependencies>
            <owncloud min-version="9.0"/>
        </dependencies>
    </info>

A full blown example would look like this (needs to be utf-8 encoded):

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <info>
        <id>news</id>

The following character maximum lengths are enforced:

* All description Strings are (almost) of unlimited size
* All Url Strings have a maximum of 256 characters
* All other Strings have a maximum of 128 characters
